              regular business customers and personal customers, and may agree
              to additional or modified terms for such arrangements. Unless
              otherwise agreed to in writing, payment is due when the invoice is
              rendered.

              herein, and the same form a fundamental basis of the bargain
              between the parties. They shall apply even if the contract between
              you and ContentConcepts is found to have failed in its essential
              purpose or has been fundamentally breached. You specifically agree
              that ContentConcepts is not liable for any offensive, defamatory,

              conditions, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using
              ContentConcepts services. While we endeavor to ensure that any
